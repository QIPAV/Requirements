%The project dependent on an external tracking system, located at KONGSBERG Innovation Center (KIC), named Qualisys. This is a motion tracking system which uses small reflective bullets to track the motion and position of the object they are placed on. By using this system, we should be able to create reproducible test results. We are going to write our own flight controller using real-time data received from Qualisys.
