\section{Scrum}
Scrum is an iterative and incremental development framework that coincides with the agile philosophy. The requirements in Scrum are represented by "User Stories". These stories are short descriptive texts written with the end-user in mind. Instead of using a traditional ranking system, Scrum re-prioritizes the tasks at each sprint and whatever is on top of the Product Backlog is the most important. A short introduction to some important elements in Scrum will follow. 

\subsection{Backlog}
Scrum has two types of backlogs, the Product Backlog and the Sprint Backlog.
\\ \\ 
\textbf{The Product Backlog} is a prioritized list of customer-centric features. The list contains every thing that might be done in the project, these are called "User Stories". During the Sprint Planning meeting, the team decomposes User Stories down to more manageable tasks and chores. Items toward the top of the Product Backlog should be small enough so that a team member could accomplish several of them (including proper testing, integration, etc.) in two-week Sprint. The Product Backlog are prioritized from highest- to lowest priority where the topmost item is the one with the highest priority.   
\\ \\ 
\textbf{The Sprint Backlog} is a collection of the User Stories which the team plan to accomplish during the Sprint. This is normally created at the Sprint Planning meeting where team members can pick User Stories from the Product Backlog and bring it into the Sprint Backlog. The team decides for themselves what they are able to do in the next Sprint. After the team members have selected User Stories, these are broken down into smaller tasks. These tasks are sorted as "to do", "in progress", "done" and "approved". As a general rule, one task should never exceed 3 days of work and should ideally be less than one days work.
When the Product Backlog Items are time-estimated, they are estimated in relative units called story points and estimated relative to each other.\\

\subsection{User Stories}
The Product Backlog Items (PBIs) are referred to as User Stories. These are features, functionality or "requirements" derived from what the customer wants or needs. The User Stories are often written from the perspective of the end user and with the customer in mind. The syntax is \textit{As a/an(user), I want/need, So that(purpose)}. The purpose of writing User Stories is to understand what the customer wants. Therefor, these Stories are often derived from conversations with the customer or stakeholders. Whereas other project models use a more standard way of representing requirements i.e the IEEE-830 Standard with \textit{"The system shall.."} - statements, Scrum utilizes User Stories. 
\\ \\
\textbf{Example of a User Story} \\
As a customer, I want the quadrotor to weigh less than 2.5kg. So that laws and regulations are held. 

\subsection{Acceptance Criteria}
In Scrum the most important user stories have Acceptance Criteria. It provides the criterion that has to be met for a user story to be assessed as complete.  
The syntax of these are: \textit{Given(some context), When(some action is carried out), Then(something expected happens).} \\
\\ 
\textbf{An example of an Acceptance Criterion} \\
Given that we have a quadrotor, when the quadrotor is weighed Then it shall be less than 2.5kg.
